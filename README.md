# study-tracker
Platform mainly created for my self and my own intrests.

Register/login, create a subject/subjects and whenever you've been studying commit with a message on what and for how long.
Either you choose to add a amount of time you want to study on a specific subject, or you just add is as "infinity", to
keep adding commits that doesn't affect the percentage done of a subject.

A lot of features could/should be added, like for instance "amount of hours/week", to keep a weekly guide on how much you want to study
on a subject.
